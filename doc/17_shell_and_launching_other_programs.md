# Shell and Launching Other Programs

## Shell

Now that we have implemented the system calls ([Talking with the kernel from User Space](./13_calling_kernel_space_routines_from_user_space.md) and [Accessing the keyboard from the Protected Mode](./14_accessing_keyboard_in_protected_mode.md.md)), [ELF file loader](./15_elf_files.md) and [Standard Library](./16_writing_user_programs_in_C.md), we have all the tools we need to implement a shell.
